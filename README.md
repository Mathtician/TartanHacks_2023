For all the baseball nerds out there, we've created a model that's trained based on about 11000 pitches from 2019 from 20 different MLB pitchers. It takes pitch data with missing features and fills them in, grouping pitchers with similar styles together. With the model, you can put in the stats of a pitcher outside of the major leagues and see how their pitching style is similar to others in the MLB, letting others see their potential through machine learning.

We used baseball data from https://github.com/stat432/pitch-analysis. As a test, we used baseball data from pitches-2019-regular-04.csv
