For all the baseball nerds out there, we've created a model that's trained based on about 11000 pitches from 2019 from 20 different MLB pitchers. It takes pitch data with missing features and fills them in, grouping pitchers with similar styles together. With the model, you can put in the stats of a new/relatively unknown pitcher and see how their pitching style is similar to others in the MLB.

We used baseball data from https://github.com/stat432/pitch-analysis. As a test, we used baseball data from pitches-2019-regular-04.csv
